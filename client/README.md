# Client

**Note to myself for my next web project:**
> Use a ES linter to get a more standardised code

> Add functions and improve the organisation of my library (api/utils) and the way to use it (export)

> Create more standardised components, not put everything in modules

> Implement Redux

> Improve the way to handle errors

## Launch on UNIX system
