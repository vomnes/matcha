This project is about creating a dating website.

I have realised this project from scratch using ReactJS, Golang, PostgreSQL, Redis, HTML and SCSS (CSS) during my studies at 'Ecole 42'.
It was first big project using ReactJS, PostgreSQL, Redis and SCSS.

I haven't used any HTML/CSS framework, everything from scratch.
